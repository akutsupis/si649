    "For this assignment we're going to recreate a visualization from a FiveThirtyEight article (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/competitive-hot-dog-eaters-have-made-america-great-again/), as well as some new and different ones. We'll be teaching you different pieces of Altair over the next few weeks so we'll focus on just a few basic chart times this time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Replicate 1 visualizations from the original article (slightly modified)\n",
    "2.   Implementing 4 new visualizations according to our specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Instructions (read the full version on the handout of the previous lab)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Save, rename, and submit the ipynb file (use your username in the name).\n",
    "*   Complete all the checkpoints, to create the required visualization at each cell\n",
    "*   Run every cell (do Runtime -> Restart and run all to make sure you have a clean working version), print to pdf, submit the pdf file. \n",
    "*   For each visualization, we will ask you to write down a \"Grammar of Graphics\" plan first (basically a description of what you'll code).\n",
    "*   If you end up stuck, show us your work by including links (URLs) that you have searched for. You'll get partial credit for showing your work in progress. \n",
